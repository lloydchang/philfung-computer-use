## Caution ⚠️
Computer use is a [beta feature from Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) that has direct access to the internet and sends screenshots of your desktop to Anthropic. 

## Setup
1. Ensure you have the latest [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/) installed.
2. You need to enable extra permissions so that this application can control your mouse and keyboard.  
* Open the 'Settings' app->click on 'Privacy and Security'->click on 'Accessibility'.</br></br>
