# Computer Use Demo for MacOS ðŸ’»

This is a fork of [Anthropic's computer use demo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo) modified to run on macOS. It allows you to experience the power and limitations of computer use firsthand.

## Caution
Computer use is a [beta feature from Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) that has direct access to the internet and sends screenshots of your desktop to Anthropic. 

## Setup
1. Ensure you have the latest [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/) installed.
2. You need to enable extra permissions so that this application can control your mouse and keyboard.  
  * Open the 'Settings' app->click on 'Privacy and Security'->click on 'Accessibility'.

git clone <this repository>
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Streamlit application.
